# portfolio

Portfolio website for Me. Made using html, css and javascript. (made for MLH-hack-your-portfolio)
This was my first multi-page site made using only html, css and javascript(rather than flask or django)
I learnt a lot of things while making this site, such as:

- 3d transforms for elements, particularly for flip cards.
- Transition attribute in css and leveraging that to get cursor trail effect.
- Using Bootstrap Cards, Grids and other components.
